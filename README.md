# WebPageTest GitHub Action
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](/LICENSE)

WebPageTest's GitHub Action lets you automatically run tests against WebPageTest on code changes. You can set and enforce performance budgets, and have performance data automatically added to your pull requets to move the performance conversation directly into your existing development workflow.

**Features:**
- Automatically run WebPageTest against code changes
- Set and enforce budgets for any metric WebPageTest can surface (spoiler alert: there are a lot)
- Complete control over WebPageTest test settings (authentication, custom metrics, scripting, etc)
- Automatically create comments on new pull requests with key metrics, waterfall and more.

## Using the Action

1. [Get a WebPageTest API Key](https://www.webpagetest.org/signup) and store it [as a secret in your repository's settings](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository).

2. Create a `.github/workflows/webpagetest-action.yml` file in your repository with the following settings:

```yml
on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: WebPageTest Action
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        
      - name: WebPageTest      
        uses: catchpoint/WebPageTest.github-action@main
        with:
          apiKey: ${{ secrets.WPT_API_KEY }}
          urls: |
            https://example.com/
            https://example.com/about
          label: 'GitHub Action Test'
```

3. Open a Pull Request. WebPageTest's GitHub Action will run in the background and post a comment on your PR.

## Configuration
By default, WebPageTest's GitHub Action will run tests whenever the event (pull_request, push, etc) you specify in your workflow is triggered. (We recommend `pull_request`).

The tests will be run with the following default WebPageTest settings:

- Location: Dulles, VA
- Browser: Chrome on an emulated Moto G4
- Connection Type: 4G connection
- Number of test runs per URL: 3
- First view only (no repeat views tested)
- The test results will be checked every **5** seconds, up to a limit of **240s**. If no results are returned by then, the test will timeout and fail.
- Each test will be labeled with the label you provide via the `label` input. 

However, WebPageTest is capable of going _very_ deep, and the GitHub Action provides a number of configuration settings to help fine-tune your tests and even fail a pull request if performance budgets aren't met.

### Available Inputs

| Input | Description | Required | Default |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `apiKey` | WebPageTest API Token | Yes | N/A |
| `urls` | List of URL(s) to test | Yes | N/A |
| `label` | Label for test (shows up in WebPageTest) | No | N/A |
| `budget` | Path to WebPageTest testspecs.json file | No | N/A |
| `wptOptions` | Path to JSON file with WebPageTest test options | No | N/A |
| `firstViewOnly` | Only capture first view | No | `true` |
| `runs` | Number of test runs | No | `3` |
| `location` | Test location to use | No | `Dulles:Chrome` |
| `connectivity` | Connectivity profile to use | No | `4G` |
| `device` | Device to emulate (e.g., iPhone14Pro, Pixel7) | No | N/A |
| `pollResults` | How frequently (in seconds) to poll for results | No | `5` |
| `timeout` | Timeout (in seconds) for test | No | `240` |
| `emulateMobile` | Emulate mobile device | No | `true` |

You can customize these settings in your workflow file like this:

```yaml
- name: WebPageTest
  uses: catchpoint/WebPageTest.github-action@main
  with:
    apiKey: ${{ secrets.WPT_API_KEY }}
    urls: |
      https://example.com/
      https://example.com/about
    label: 'GitHub Action Test'
    runs: 5
    location: 'ec2-us-east-1:Chrome'
    connectivity: '3G'
    timeout: 300
    emulateMobile: false


### Setting performance budgets
WebPageTest's GitHub Action uses the [WebPageTest API Wrapper for NodeJS](https://github.com/catchpoint/WebPageTest.api-nodejs) under the hood. The wrapper provides [test specs](https://github.com/catchpoint/WebPageTest.api-nodejs/wiki/Test-Specs) functionality that lets you set budgets on any of the metrics returned by the WebPageTest API.

The GitHub Action lets you provide a path to a specs JSON file using the `budget` input. If a specs file is included, WebPageTest's GitHub Action will test the results against the budgets you've defined. If any budget isn't met, the tests will fail and you'll be provided with links to dig into the full WebPageTest results to see what was slowing things down.

For example, given the following configuration:

```yml
on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: WebPageTest Action
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        
      - name: WebPageTest
        uses: catchpoint/WebPageTest.github-action@main
        with:
          apiKey: ${{ secrets.WPT_API_KEY }}
          urls: |
            https://example.com/
            https://example.com/about
          label: 'GitHub Action Test'
          budget: 'wpt-budget.json'
```

And a `wpt-budget.json` file containing:

```json
{
 "median": {
     "firstView": {
         "firstContentfulPaint": 1000
     }
 }   
}
```

WebPageTest would test each run's First Contentful Paint. If the First Contentful Paint fires in less than 1 second, the test passes; if not, the test would fail.

![Example of a WPT action failing the PR if a budget is exceeded](/images/wpt-action-fail-pr.png)

The specs format provides tremendous flexiblity in which metrics you want to budget against. For more information, check out [the official documentation](https://github.com/catchpoint/WebPageTest.api-nodejs/wiki/Test-Specs).

### Testing against a deployment URL
If you are going to set and enforce performance budgets, **make sure to pass a preview URL** to test against to make sure that you're testing against the latest changes, not against a prior version of your site.

As an example, if you happen to be using a service like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), they'll generate deploy previews for each PR. Here's an example of how you could run the WebPageTest action against the latest deploy preview using the [Wait for Netlify Action](https://github.com/JakePartusch/wait-for-netlify-action).

```yml
on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: WebPageTest Action
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        
      - name: Wait for the Netlify Preview
        uses: jakepartusch/wait-for-netlify-action@v1.2
        id: netlify
        with:
          site_name: 'your-netlify-site-name'

      - name: WebPageTest
        uses: catchpoint/WebPageTest.github-action@main
        with:
          apiKey: ${{ secrets.WPT_API_KEY }}
          urls: |
            ${{ steps.netlify.outputs.url }}
            ${{ steps.netlify.outputs.url }}/about
          label: 'GitHub Action Test'
          budget: 'wpt-budget.json'
          wptOptions: 'wpt-options.json'
```

_If you are testing against a Netlify deployment preview, it's important to note that the new collaborative features for their previews inject a full single-page application into your page, messing with any performance thresholds you might be trying to enforce. Add the following to your wptOptions JSON to make sure none of the extra code makes it into your test results_

```
"block": "netlify-cdp-loader.netlify.app"
```

### Customizing your WebPageTest tests
There are a _lot_ of [options available in WebPageTest](https://github.com/catchpoint/WebPageTest.api-nodejs#test-works-for-runtest-method-only) to customize your test results, record custom metrics, or do advanced scripting and multi-page flows.

To give you the ability to customize you tests, the WebPageTest GitHub Action let's you provide the path to a JSON object with your test options, using the `wptOptions` input.

For example, given the following configuration:

```yml
on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: WebPageTest Action
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        
      - name: WebPageTest
        uses: catchpoint/WebPageTest.github-action@main
        with:
          apiKey: ${{ secrets.WPT_API_KEY }}
          urls: |
            https://example.com/
            https://example.com/about
          label: 'GitHub Action Test'
          budget: 'wpt-budget.json'
          wptOptions: 'wpt-options.json'
```

And a `wpt-options.json` file containing:

```json
{
    "runs": 1,
    "location": "Dulles:Chrome",
    "connectivity": "Cable",
    "blockAds": true
}
```

The defaults values for the number of runs, location, and connectivity type would all be overwritten by the settings specified here. In addition, any ads defined by https://adblockplus.org/ would be automatically blocked.
